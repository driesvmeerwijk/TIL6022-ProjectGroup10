# Research question

# We are looking into the influence of Covid on flighttravel behaviour. For this we are first looking to the amount of flights departing from Eindhoven, an airport in The Netherlands, form where only non-intercontinental flights depart. Then we compare this to flights made during the Covid years and lastly we want to see the influence Covid had on the travel behaviour later. That is why we also look into the amount of flights after the pandemic was over. For this, we only take into account human traffic from and to Eindhoven airport, one year before Covid, the years during Covid and the year after.
