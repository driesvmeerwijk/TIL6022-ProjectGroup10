By the end of 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic had spread over the globe and had a profound effect on every area of peoples' daily lives. 
Many steps were taken to restrict social connections and provide adequate social distance in order to stop the virus from spreading. 
As a result, daily travel habits have drastically altered. In order to get a deeper understanding of the reasons behind the changes in travel patterns during a worldwide crisis regarding the usage of public transport in the Netherlands, we classified individuals into different groups.
These groups are based on differences in gender, income and age.
As a result, we compared and analysed the travel patterns of these groups prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our goal is to obtain an overview of the effects of COVID-19 on travel behaviour based on these analyses.

The conclusions for eacht of the subquestions were:
The participation difference between men women did not change much when comparing the pre-covid and post-covid eras.
The absolute difference between men women was 1.2% before the outbreak, 2 years after the outbreak this difference was 0.9%.  
But among both men and women, the decline in participation was 30%, so the relative difference remains about the same.
So there could be concluded that the Covid pandemic did not have any effect on the difference in usage of public transport between men and women.
